Implementation of proposed methods for solving University Course Timetabling with Minimizing the Number of Allocated Classroom

These are proposed methods for solving a version of university course timetabling problem where the number of utilized classrooms is the objective.

GeneticAlgorithm_SimulatedAnnealing.py is a hybrid heuristic approach. In this approach the GA finds a feasible solution and this solution is feed to SA to improve the number of classrooms.

The 3rd track (Curriculum Based Course Timetabling) of the well-known dataset of International Timetabling Competition (ITC) 2007 http://www.cs.qub.ac.uk/itc2007/ used for testing the performance of methods.
