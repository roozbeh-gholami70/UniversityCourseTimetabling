Each instance is in a single file, containing a file header and four sections: courses, rooms, curricula, and constraints. 
The header provides all scalar values and each section provides the arrays for that specific aspect of the problem. 
The exact format is shown by the following example (for a tiny instance):

Name: ToyExample
Courses: 4
Rooms: 2
Days: 5
Periods_per_day: 4
Curricula: 2
Constraints: 8

COURSES:
SceCosC Ocra 3 3 30
ArcTec Indaco 3 2 42
TecCos Rosa 5 4 40
Geotec Scarlatti 5 4 18

ROOMS:
A 32
B 50

CURRICULA:
Cur1 3 SceCosC ArcTec TecCos
Cur2 2 TecCos Geotec

UNAVAILABILITY_CONSTRAINTS:
TecCos 2 0
TecCos 2 1
TecCos 3 2
TecCos 3 3
ArcTec 4 0
ArcTec 4 1
ArcTec 4 2
ArcTec 4 3

END.

The lines in the header and the following sections are always provided in the precise order as the example. The data in the various sections must be interpreted as follows:

Courses: <CourseID> <Teacher> <# Lectures> <MinWorkingDays> <# Students>
Rooms: <RoomID> <Capacity>
Curricula: <CurriculumID> <# Courses> <MemberID> ... <MemberID>
Unavailability_Constraints: <CourseID> <Day> <Day_Period>

All IDs are strings without blanks. Days and periods start from 0. 
For example, the constraint TecCos 3 2 states that course TecCos cannot be scheduled in the third (2) period of Thursday (3)
