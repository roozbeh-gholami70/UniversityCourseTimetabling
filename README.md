Implementation of proposed methods for solving University Course Timetabling with Minimizing the Number of Allocated Classroom

These are proposed methods for solving a version of university course timetabling problem where the number of utilized classrooms is the objective.

GeneticAlgorithm_SimulatedAnnealing.py is a hybrid heuristic approach. In this approach the GA finds a feasible solution and this solution is feed to SA to improve the number of classrooms.
